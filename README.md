      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        With a strong foundation in enterprise SaaS, I specialize in transforming complex accounting workflows into intuitive, data-driven product experiences. By blending analytical rigor with human-centered design, I collaborate closely with stakeholders to uncover insights, align on goals, and deliver scalable solutions that drive business impact. Empathy and transparency guide how I work, and Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve, learn something new, and have a little fun along the way! Outside of work, you'll catch me deep in a suspense novel, headbanging at a metal show, or spending way too much time in my Steam library.
